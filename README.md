**Disclaimer:** IANAL and may have missed something. This is intended as a learning tool and you should *definitely* consult a lawyer if you have any questions or concerns. This is a work in progress, so suggestions and pull requests are welcome!

##### Intro
Other than building a product people want, incorporating a new business is essential to raising money, opening a bank account, and creating a legal entity for contracts and other liabilities. For technical folks like me, it's the "necessary evil" of founding a company and just needs to get done. Having gone through this recently, I made a checklist in case I'd have to do it again in the near future.

Some notes:
- The full process will take several weeks to complete
- Most steps are sequential and depend on an earlier step being complete
- Many steps require the use of snail mail or a [fax machine](#resources)
- For brevity, Delaware and California are shortened to **DE** and **CA**


# The checklist
- [ ] Choose a name for your business and check that it's available. [DE Name Search](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx) & [CA Name Search](http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/)
- [ ] Generate incorporation documents and sign them [[service]](#free-res1)
- [ ] Buy registered agent service in DE - **1 yr Free**
- [ ] File incorporation docs with DE - **~$150 including fees for 1 week service**
  - You can do this yourself, but it will probably take longer and not save you much money
- [ ] Apply for a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) - **Free**
  - [IRS info & form](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online)
  - Expect the IRS to mail you a document containing your *EFTPS Pin*. This allows you to pay federal taxes electronically
- [ ] *(only for S-corp)* File IRS Form 2553 to convert C-corp to S-corp
  - [IRS Form 2553](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2553.pdf)

**NOTE:** Most of the following steps require a valid U.S. checking account and the steps above allow you to open an account. This is probably the best time to do so.
- [ ] Order certified copy of *Certificate of Good Standing* from DE **$50**
  - Fill out [DE fillable form](https://corp.delaware.gov/certmemo.pdf) and fax to (302) 739-3812
- [ ] Sign up for Registered agent service in CA **1 yr free**
- [ ]

### Setting up Federal and CA payroll tax payments

- [ ] Sign up to make IRS payroll tax payments electronically **Free**
  - Enroll via phone call to IRS 1-800-555-3453 
    - have your EFTPS Pin and checking account info handy
    - be prepared to write down *enrollment number*
  - Set password via [EFTPS password form](https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/login/forgotPassword)
  - Check enrollment via [EFTPS login form](https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/login/loginInitial)
