##### Intro
Other than building a product people want, incorporating a new business is essential to raising money, opening a bank account, and creating a legal entity for contracts and other liabilities. For technical folks like me, it's the "necessary evil" of founding a company and just needs to get done. Having gone through this recently, I made a checklist in case I'd have to do it again in the near future.

Some notes:
- The full process will take several weeks to complete
- Most steps are sequential and depend on an earlier step being complete
- Many steps require the use of snail mail or a [fax machine](#resources)
- For brevity, Delaware and California are shortened to **DE** and **CA**


## The checklist
- [ ] Pick a name for your business and check that it's available. [DE Name Search](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx) & [CA Name Search](http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/)
- [ ] Generate incorporation documents and sign them [[1]](#fres1)
- [ ] Buy registered agent service in DE
